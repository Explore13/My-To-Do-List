## ABOUT ME
Hi! I'm Surya Ghosh,from Medinipur in West Bengal. I'm currently pursuing B.Tech. in `Electronics and Communication Engineering` at Future Institute of Engineering and Management.

The GitHub repository for the `To-Do List`, which includes the `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`, has been successfully created. I intend to host this webpage.

## To-Do List 
Welcome to my first project during my first internship! In this project, I have created a simple and responsive To-Do List using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Overview
The To-Do List is a web application that allows users to create and manage their tasks efficiently. 
It provides a user-friendly interface where you can easily add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks that are no longer needed. 
The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
### HTML:
Used for creating the structure and layout of the web page.
### CSS: 
Used for styling the elements and making the application visually appealing.
### JavaScript: 
Used to implement the dynamic functionality of the To-Do List, such as adding and removing tasks and updating their status.

## Features
You can easily add new tasks to your to-do list by typing them into the input field and pressing enter or clicking the `Add` button.
Once you have finished a task, you can mark it as completed by clicking the `checkbox` before to the task.
If a task is no longer needed, you can delete it from the list by clicking the `x` icon.

## Future Improvements
As this is my first project as an Intern, there is always room for improvement. Here are some ideas for future enhancements:

#### Task prioritization :
Implementing a feature that allows users to prioritize tasks based on their importance or deadlines.
#### Task categories or labels : 
Adding the ability to categorize tasks into different groups or labels for better organization.
#### User authentication : 
Implementing a login system to allow multiple users to manage their individual to-do lists.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to express my gratitude to `@LetsGrowMore` for providing me with the opportunity to work on this project and gain valuable experience. Special thanks to `@LetsGrowMore Community` for their guidance and support throughout the internship.

Feel free to explore the project and provide any feedback or suggestions. I hope you find this To-Do List application useful!
